@369Martin369's Crypto Tracker Lilygo T-Display S3 &amp; touch

this ESP32 project is the worldwide first wallet tracker for CEx binance. It reads out all your tokens in the wallet and converts it to EUR or USDT, so that you can see your total crypto holdings in realtime (1hz)
Die Wallet is truely mobile. is you hold the buttons 2 sec it goes to sleep. with the reset button you wake it up and can readout your wallet value a few secends after refresh has happend.

Although it is the first mobile Binance tracker of its kind in the world, I decided to share the source code in the public domain.
