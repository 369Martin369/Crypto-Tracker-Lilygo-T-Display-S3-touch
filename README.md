@369Martin369's Crypto Tracker Lilygo T-Display S3 &amp; touch

This ESP32 project is the world's first wallet tracker for CEx binance. It reads out all your tokens from your wallet and converts it to EUR or USDT, so that you can see your total crypto holdings, in realtime (ca.1hz)
This Wallet is truely mobile. If you press any button for 2 sec, it goes to sleep mode drawing only a few uA. With the reset button you can wake it up again and can readout your wallet value, a few secends after refresh has happend.

Although it is the first mobile Binance tracker of its kind in the world, I decided to share the source code in the public domain.
